Scenario 1:
Henry is a 4th year undergraduate student at University of California, Los Angeles studying business. He currently lives with his 6 roommates in an apartment close to the school. He just got a new higher paying job that is slightly further away and needs a car to get to his new workplace. He would take the bus, but since it is further away than his previous job, it will take double the amount of time to get there due to the constant stops. Getting a car will allow him to save more time and give him more flexibility to travel around Los Angeles. First, Henry asks around to see if anyone he knows is selling a car, but unfortunately, nobody is. So, he goes onto craigslist to search for a cheap used, but reliable car that will get him through the rest of the school year. 
Henry first goes onto the online marketplace site on his laptop and enters in his zipcode to refine the area limit to be within Los Angeles. This way, he does not need to travel far to get the seller. He then searches up the word “car” in the search bar. He ends up wil thousands of results and begins scrolling through all the pages. He then goes back to the main page by clicking the website name on the upper left corner. He then looks at all the categories that are listed in the front page and clicks “for sale”. His webpage moves to a different screen that shows all the categories under ‘for sale’. Henry sees a picture with a vehicle that says “ transportation” underneath the image. He clicks on the image which takes him to another category that displays images of different modes of transportation. He selects the image with a car which brings him to a popup that helps filter the results. In this pop up, Henry checks off the boxes for economic and 4-door and he types in the minimum price as $0 and the maximum price as $5,000. He then clicks the “filter” button on the bottom right of the popup and his results begin to show up. He scrolls through 25 pages of cars that interest him to find one that suits him the most. He then clicks into the post to find the contact information of the seller and emails the seller that he is interested. 

Journey Map:
Initiation:
Henry has a new job that requires him to have a car since traveling on the bus will take too much time. He is unable to find a friend or an acquaintance that is selling a car, so he turns to the internet. He does not want to spend too much money, so he decides to go to an online marketplace site to find a cheap yet reliable car for transportation. 
Frustrations:
When initially just typing in the word “car” in the search bar, he ended up with hundreds of thousands sof results and anything relating to a car. His result ranged from real cars to small toy cars for children and he did not want to shuffle through thousands of pages to find a car. 
Solution:
So, Henry went back to the main page of the site and began selecting through the general categories of the site which are listed as images in the front of the main page. He slowly clicks through them, refining his search items for sale to modes of transportation to cars. Then the popup allowed him to easily filter through his searches by selecting what features he wanted. Then, he had 25 pages worth of car within his budget and preferences. 
Goal:
Henry was successful in finding and filtering cars that were of his preferences and also within his budget. Afterwards, he had a good and solid list of cars to choose from. This allowed him to contact the different sellers of cars that he is considering to buy. Ultimately, finding the perfect car for his uses without spending a tremendous amount of money.

I am more interested in the new condition items at retail stores, this is cheaper and more resourceful. 
I need to spend less and save up more money for the future house. 
Hopefully I can find an item that I am satisfied with that is cheaper and newer looking.
Feels:
Annoyed: She did not see very many trustworthy postings of items she wanted. She doesn't know who she can trust to buy from and which ones are scams. 
Disappointed: That she needs to save up money for a new house.

Scenario 2:
Jennifer is currently living in an apartment with two other roommates, but she intends to move into a new house with her recently wedded husband. She is currently saving up money for that venture, but she just broke her desk from attempting to stand on it to change a lightbulb on the ceiling. Since she is moving soon, she needs a temporary replacement until the lease is up at her current apartment and she moves to a new house. She is picky and prefers to buy new and aesthetic items, but she realizes that she is moving out soon and will need a new desk for the house. So, the most logical plan for Jennifer is to buy a cheap temporary replacement that still looks aesthetic. She decides to go onto an online marketplace to find a desk she likes for a much cheaper price than retail prices. 
She goes onto an online marketplace site to begin searching for desks. Since Jennifer tends to shop in department stores, she is inexperienced with online marketplaces. So, she first searches for desks by typing “desk” in the search bar on the front page. Then, she clicks the ‘search’ button to display her results. She is greeted with a page full of images of desks. She scrolls through pages of them and finds several desks that she is interested in, however, she doesn’t know if the sellers are trustworthy to buy from. So, she goes to the filter bar on the left side of the webpage and selects the filter ‘craigslist’s picks’. This reloads her results and she is presented with results that include all sellers that provided proper and adequate information about the desk they are selling. This allows Jennifer to know that these people are serious about selling their items. Additionally, on the top edge of the product image, there will be a trophy symbol that represents the seller who has made several successful transactions in the past. Therefore, those people are more trustworthy than those who are posting for the first time. With the ‘craigslist’s picks’ filter and the trophy identifier, Jennifer is able to look through a list of desks that she can pick from with little worry about a fake posting. After several pages of scrolling, she decides on a desk that fits her room aesthetic and is in a relatively new condition. This post was picked through the ‘craigslist’s picks’ filter and has a trophy symbol, meaning this seller had successful transactions in the past. 
Journey Map:
Initiation:
Jennifer has a broken desk, but she is unwilling to spend much money on it because she intends to move to a new house soon. So, she just needs a desk that fits with her room aesthetic and that will last for a short period of time. So, Jennifer decides to go onto an online marketplace to find something very cheap that will do the job. 
Frustrations:
During her search, she found many desks that appealed to her, but she was unsure if the sellers were trustworthy to buy from or not. She did not want to look at desks that she was not able to buy. She has little experience with buy off of online marketplace sites, so she is unable to tell what makes a post trustworthy or not. 
Solution:
So, she selected the ‘craigslist’s picks’ filter in order to automatically filter out any posts that do not fulfill the basic requirements and do not provide sufficient information. Then she looked at the trophy on the top right corner of the image posts to see which sellers have sold in the past and had successful transactions. 
Goal:
Ultimately, she was able to filter out all posts that were not as trustworthy and looked through the postings that had much higher chances of being real. Due to her skepticism, she only looked through the postings with a trophy. After a couple of pages searching, she was able to find a desk she liked that had a trophy symbol, symbolizing the trustworthiness of the seller.

She is hoping to save up enough money by working more to move to a nice neighborhood in the near future and save up money for her son’s future.

Scenario 3: 
Daphne is currently working extra shifts and hours to save up money to move to a nicer neighborhood with her son. She wants to be able to provide her son with anything she can to give him a proper childhood even with a constantly working single mother. Daphne is trying to let her son learn and experience what other kids his age experience. So, she wants her son to learn how to ride a bike, so she would like to buy a bike for her six year old son. She knows that there is a decent amount of thievery in her neighborhood, so she prefers to purchase a used bike for now and buy a better bike when they move neighborhoods. Daphne is extremely terrible and slow with technology since she rarely uses her very out of date phone and laptop. 
Daphne opens her laptop and opens her typical web browser, and searches for where to buy used items in the search bar. She looks through her results and selects a popular site for an online marketplace. She goes onto the site she found earlier and types ” children bicycle” in the search bar and clicks the ‘search’ button. She looks through the images and struggles to find the right bicycle that she would like. She finally clicks on one of the postings, but she is so overwhelmed with the amount of information on the posting. She struggles to find the contact information of the seller since the page seems to be mostly about the product’s information. She clicks the back button on the top left of the browser to go back to the previous page. She looks at the posting that she was interested in one more time, but this time instead of clicking on the image of the posting, she notices a pen symbol on the bottom right corner of the image. She clicks the symbol and a popup window shows up that says “Quick Contact Seller” at the top then has a message box under the title. With this Daphne is able to express her interests and ask for more information on the bike to the seller without having to dig through the page for the contact information. 
Journey Map:
Initiation:
Daphne would like to buy a cheap used bike to prevent others from stealing a nice new bike and for her son to learn how to ride a bike. She would like to buy the bike online so she can remotely look at the bike rather than having to meet others just to see the bike. She chooses to buy the bike from an online marketplace because the prices there are cheaper for used bikes, so even if the bike was stolen, she would not be worried. 
Frustrations:
She found it difficult to navigate through the internet and had difficulty finding specific information. She realizes that she is not tech savvy but she would still like to be able to efficiently use a site without prior experience. Most importantly, she was not able to find the contact information on the posting due to the overflow of information and small buttons located all around the web page. 
Solution:
She was able to back out of the posting page by clicking back to the last page on her browser. There, she was able to see a write a message pencil symbol, so she was able to click the symbol under the bike she was interested in. In return, this allowed her to directly message the seller without having to dig through the posting to find the contact information. 
Goal: 
Daphne was able to find a bike at a low price on the online marketplace site that she was interested in. She was then able to contact the seller to ask additional information and let him know that she was interested in purchasing the bike.
